# B2G_TriggerEfficiencies

This repository contains the code to calculate trigger efficiencies that is used by the B2G trigger contacts.
It is using the orthogonal dataset method and mainly targets hadronic triggers, like our jet mass triggers (HLT_AK8PFJet400_MassSD30).

## Usage

Important note: this framework requires a python installation that has coffea and xrootd installed.
This might be set up locally using anaconda, or based on some central enviromnemt.
(I am currently checking what is available on lxplus -Finn)
